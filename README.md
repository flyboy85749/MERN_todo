# ME_N_todo is a full stack to do list, using MongoDB, Express, and Node. Also uses EJS for templating.

## The home page has a title for the notes list of today. You can add items by typing in the input box, and then clicking add. To delete an item, click on the checkbox for the item you want to delete.

## To make another list, say for work, add a /"topic" at the end of the address in the address bar. Then add items as desired. For instance, I created a work list that you can see <a href="https://morning-mesa-69657.herokuapp.com/work">here</a>
